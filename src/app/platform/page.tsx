    a: "ERIX 1.0 is live with four parts on one customer record. ERIX CRM: contacts, pipeline, forms, appointments, proposals, projects with documents, e-sign and a client portal, GST invoices and payment links. ERIX Connect: WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, email, website chat, Google Calendar and Meet, and Razorpay. ERIX Flow: automations, templates, approvals, Wait for a reply and AI reply. AI agents: the sales, channels and website agents. ERIX Storage keeps files inside projects. ERIX LAIE is invite only.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a public ERIX API?",
    a: "Yes. The same modules are available through the REST API at https://api.ecodrix.com, with keys per workspace, webhooks and the public SDK @ecodrix/erix-api.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use just one part of ERIX?",
    a: "Yes. Most teams start with the inbox or the pipeline and switch on the rest as they go. Everything writes to the same contact, so nothing has to be moved later.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does ERIX update in real time?",
    a: "Yes. New messages, ticks, typing, pipeline moves and automation runs appear live, so nobody on your team has to refresh.",
