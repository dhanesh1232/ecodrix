// Server Component: every section renders to HTML, so crawlers and link
// previews see the real content without running JavaScript. Motion only
// enhances what's already there (framer-motion islands, globals.css →
// "Motion"). The page tells one story: promise → where leads go missing →
// every channel in, every outcome out (the beam, founder's must-have) →
// one enquiry's life in ERIX (the story) → inside ERIX (Connect, CRM, Flow,
// Analytics, one screen each) → the agent → everything in 1.0 →
// India → a day in each trade → why ECODrIx exists and how pilots work →
// proof → FAQ → call to action. No pricing during the pilot: terms are
// agreed with each client (founder decision).
